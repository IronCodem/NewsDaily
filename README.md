# **NewsDaily** #
 Hey everyone! So, I made a news website where you can do many things that I added onto it. But, please, for signing-up, one account per person because that could cause file-handling troubles which will be saved as a `*.txt` file. Read that section for more.
 
 #
## **1. Read Articles** ##
 This means that you can view reports first-hand if you sign-up. Most articles will be available anyways to anyone.
 ###### Articles not yet available.
 
 #
## **2. A Sign-up Feature** ##
 In this, you can create an account so that you can view _premium_ articles which are not present if you do not make a ledger (account).
  - **This feature is not yet available.**
  - When it is, all accounts are _free_.
 
 #
## **3. A Monthly Survey** ##
 You don't _have_ to participate in these, but it is always appreciated and highly recommended. This is so I get feedback as well as improve any discomforts.
 
 #
## **So, that's About It!** ##
 Well, this about raps-up my `README.md` file! Enjoy my news site!
